title: Wrap Up My Postdoc Life
---

This is the first blog in recording my new journey in academics.

## Why build this blog?
I have been suffered from symptoms of **procrastination** for a quite long time. So I am trying to use this blog to track my behaviors to figure out whether I could get rid of it and how.

I list down my todos in Feb, 2021 before my departure:
1. Ending the Research Project
- [ ] Finalize the calculation of results
- [ ] Sort out the result summary
- [ ] Sentences for the story

2. Writing Proposal(s)
- [ ] Timeline of NSFC

3. Backing Up My Resources
- [ ] Code on workstation
- [ ] Account for academic databanks
